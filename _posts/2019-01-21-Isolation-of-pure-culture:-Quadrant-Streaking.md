# Objective: 
## After going through this experiment you will be able to,
- Demonstrate good aseptic technique in culture transfer or inoculation and handling sterile materials.
- Demonstrate skill in isolation of organism from a mixed culture.
- Isolate microorganism from a wide variety of sources and describe their colony morphology.

# Theory:

- Aseptic techniques: Aseptic techniques (also called sterile techniques) are defined as the processes required for transferring a culture from one vessel to another without introducing any additional organism to the culture or contaminating the environment with culture. 
- Following conditions must exist for aseptic technique to be successful,


    1. The work area must be wiped with disinfectant to reduce the number of potential contaminants.

    2. The transfer must be sterile.

    3. The work must be accomplished quickly and efficiently to minimize the time of exposure during which contamination of the culture can occur.

- Streak plate technique (Quadrant Streaking): It is used for isolation into pure culture of the organism (mostly bacteria), from a mixed population. The original sample is diluted by streaking it over successive quadrants. The number of organism’s decreases and usually by the third or fourth quadrant only a few organisms are transferred which give discrete colony forming units (CFUs).


- Pure cultures can be obtained by picking well isolated colonies and re-streaking these on fresh agar plates.

# Requirements:

    • Bacterial culture, nutrient agar plates, inoculating loop, Bunsen burner.

# Protocol:

    1. Prepare the agar plates by pouring the medium into petri dishes.

    2. Turn these culture media plates bottom side up and label the perimeter of the dishes with your initials, date, type of medium and specimen.

    3. Hold the inoculating loop between your thumb and index figure, insert the wire portion into the Bunsen burner flame, heating the entire length of the wire until it is red and glowing. Allow the wire to cool before doing the next step. Do not wave the loop.

    4. Using your free hand, pick up the tube/plate containing the mixed culture. Remove the tube plug with free fingers of the hands holding the sterile inoculating loop and carefully flame the lip of the tube in the Bunsen burner flame.

    5. Insert the sterile loop and remove a small amount of growth. Try not to touch the sides of the tube with the loop.

# Isolation of pure culture - Quadrant Streaking


    6. Expose the agar surface of each plate for inoculation by raising the lid at an angle over the agar, thus keeping the plate surface protected from aerial contamination.

    7. Spread the selected colony growth on the agar surface forming a well like structure. Then heat the inoculating loop to kill the microorganism from its surface.

    8. Raise the lid of the sterile plate and streak the first quadrant using sterile loop. Stretch four parallel lines away from the well. Other quadrant streaks should originate from previous stretched lines.

    9. Repeat the step 8 to streak remaining three quadrants.

    10. Then incubate the streak plate at 37 degree Celsius for 24 hours.

    11. Record the results.

# Discussion:

- Streaking is a technique used in microbiology to isolate a pure strain from a single species of microorganism, often bacteria. A microbial culture can be grown so that the organism can be identified, studied, or tested.


- The loop is sterilized after streaking of each quadrant.


- The streak plate is then incubated for 24 hours, to allow bacteria to reproduce. At the end of incubation there should be enough bacteria to form visible colonies. Single bacterial colonies can be identified based on their morphology differences and then sub cultured to a new media plate.

# Conclusion:


- All the colonies [isolated] formed after incubation had same general appearance.


- A single type of colony is formed; i.e. hybrid colonies were not formed.

# Observation:


- After streaking we observed that single colonies were formed in the fourth quadrant of the streak plate.

# Precaution:

    • Only a small amount of inoculum should be used.

    • Streak lightly so that you do not gouge the agar.

    • Flame the loop after you streak each quadrant.

    • Make sure that the surface of the plate is free of droplets of condensed moisture.

    • Streaking should be performed inside a laminar air flow only.

    • The working area should be disinfected with 70% ethanol before performing the experiment.

    • While incubating the bacterial plates should be closed and secured with wax or tape.

    • Any unwanted bacterial plates should be disposed of properly by placing them in an autoclave to kill the microorganism before discarding them.
