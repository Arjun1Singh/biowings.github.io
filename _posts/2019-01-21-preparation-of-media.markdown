# Objectives:
After going through this experiment you will be able to,

- Explain the role of nutritional requirement in the cultivation of microorganism in laboratory
- Acquire knowledge about microbial media used for different purpose
- Prepare media for microbial analysis[Nutrient Broth and Agar]

# Principle:
- The ingredients in culture media range from pure chemical compounds to complex materials such as extracts or digests of plant and animal tissues. If all the ingredients of a culture medium are known, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the medium is called a chemically defined medium. These media are of great value in studying the nutritional requirement of microorganisms or in studying a great variety of metabolic activity.

- In a complex medium, the exact chemical composition is not known, and such a medium is often prepared from very complex material, e.g. body fluids, peptones etc. 

- Commonly used constituents in microbiology media;
    1. Agar: Agar is the major solidifying agent used in bacteriological media. It is a complex polysaccharide gum obtained from red algae(Brief description of red algae). It is added as a powder at a more or less standard concentration [1.5% for plates and slanted media, and <= 0.5% for semisolid media], usually after media components have been added and dissolved in water. Agar dissolves at approximately 90-95 degree Celsius and an agar containing medium thus heated will not solidify until temperature is brought down to about 43 degree Celsius.

    2. Beef Extract: Eukaryotic tissues(beef extract) is extracted by boiling and concentrating it to a powder. These extracts are frequently used as a source of amino acids, vitamins and coenzymes. Many such extracts also are needed as growth factors.

    3. Peptones: These complex mixtures of organic and inorganic compounds are obtained by digestion of protein – containing tissues of animals and plants such as beef muscle, milk protein, etc. Peptones primarily contain peptides and single amino acids.
    d. Salts: Salts such as NaCl are added to N.A so as to maintain an optimum electrolyte concentration.

    4. Buffers: These compounds are added to maintain the optimum pH range of the organism.

- Use of Nutrient Agar(N.A.): Nutrient broth is a liquid medium used for cultivation of microorganism which are non-demanding in their nutrietional requirements, and the addition of agar to the broth gives a solid medium(Nutrient Agar). It is an all-purpose media.

# Requirements: 
- Autoclave, weighing balance, heating mantle, pH meter, laminar air flow, stirrer, distilled water, media, test tubes, beakers, cotton plugs, measuring cylinder, beef extract, peptone, agar, NaCl, 1N NaOH, 1N HCl.

- Protocols:
- General steps for preparation of nutrient agar involve the following
    1. Carefully weigh the proper amount of constituent ingredients and dissolve in appropriate volume of distilled water.
    2. Determine the pH of the medium, and adjust if necessary with dilute acid or alkali.
    3. Add agar (1.5-2%) and boil the medium to dissolve the agar.
    4. Sterilize by autoclaving at 15psi pressure (121 degree Celsius) for 15-20 minutes.

# Composition of medium

|Ingredients|grms/liter|
|---|---|
|1. Peptone         |   0.5|
|2. Sodium Chloride |   0.5|
|3. Beef Extract    |   0.3|
|4. Agar            |   1.5|
|5. Distilled Water | 100ml|

# Observation:
- The prepared media is to be stored in a cool, dry place in an appropriate container. Observe the pH using pH meter. At times, tubes and flasks containing media may be incubated at 37 degree Celsius for 48hrs before use to detect and eliminate any possible contamination.

# Result:
- After performing this experiment we well obtain media that is suitable for growth of of bacteria, that is Nutrient agar.

# Precaution:
- The compound’s contains should not be left open for long as most of the constituents are hygroscopic.
- Only clean glassware should be used for preparation of media.
- Weighing should be accurate and pH must be adjusted before putting for autoclave.
- If possible, prepare media just before use. Repeated storage autoclaving must be avoided.
- Avoid excessive heating of the media, as agar tends to clump at high temperatures.
- If the medium is not used the same day it is prepared, store it properly in moisture proof containers to avoid drying of the medium.
- Avoid overloading autoclaves.
- Flask or test tubes should be plugged with cotton plugs or capped with paper.
